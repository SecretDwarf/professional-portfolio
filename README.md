# Overview
## This is my personal portfolio that I created using React. The base was built using npm create react app.

# Web Pages
## Landing page: the landing page is the first view on the site and introduces the 8-bit and pixel theme that I've gone with. It features a typescript animation to list some of my skills and hobbies as well as links to the other pages. Its animated background also tracks the cursor to make a waterfall effect with raining pixels as a backdrop.

## Resume Page: The resume page utilizes an embedded Google doc so as I update my resume It is automatically updated in my portfolio. The resume page has an animated background set up as a grid and creates randomly colored blocks as the cursor passes over each square in the grid.

## Contact Page: The contact page uses email JS to route the information from the contact form to my email. Feel free to try it out if you have any questions.

# Development Environment
I built my portfolio using React JS. I use VS Code as my main IDE and plan to host this webpage in the near future. I started the project with create-react-app and I used Email JS to connect my contact page to my email. I'm also using the react-router-dom and react-typescript-animation, which I installed using npm.
